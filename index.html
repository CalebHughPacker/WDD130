    <p>Hi! I'm Caleb Packer and I'm from Marietta, Georgia. I'm a Computer Science major here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
    <p>I enjoy programming and I also love hiking, sports, and learning new things. I am excited to take this course and discover the basics of web design.</p>
    <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have always been an active member including a two-year mission to Natal, Brazil. One scripture that has gotten me through much of life is choose you this day whom ye will serve; ... but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. (Joshua 24:15)</p>
